<p> My name is Ryan mansbridge, student ID: S3851986 and email: S3851986@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia, but I have Scottish background. I  Finished year 12 in 2018 and I decided  to work for a year before I started to study at RMIT, I can only speak English fluently but I can  speak a little bit of French and Indonesian, which I learnt in high school. I coach a under 14’s Victorian junior Basketball team which represents our club which is Chelsea Gulls.</P>

  <p>The thing that probably interests me the most about IT is that it is constantly changing, and new things are being created like Tesla and their experimental driverless vehicles. I started getting interested into IT when I was about 6 when I got my first gaming console the PS2 I got hoked onto this and since then I have liked the aspects of IT. There wasn’t really one person who sparked my interest in IT, it was more me watching my older cousins play games as well as watching YouTube. When I was in high school, I did IT subjects all the way threw to year 11, as well as now I am working as a printer which uses some IT aspects like computers.</p>

  <p>The Reason why I chose to study at RMIT was mainly my mates telling me too, because I didn’t go straight into university after high school and worked instead for a year all my friends went to university and some of them went to RMIT and told me that it good especially the IT course, which I decided to stud. I chose to study online however because I personally prefer to do work online rather then be in a classroom all day, I get more freedom studying online.</P>


   <p>With the what I expect to learn from my studies, I’m not too sure what I expect to learn, but what I do want to learn is how to create my own website as well how the basic computer works and how all the computer components work like the CPU and mother board. I would also like to learn the background of IT like who created the first IT aspect.</p>

<p>This job is really appealing to me because cyber security is something that I have always wanted to do a learn. This job works with the Melbourne government and the Melbourne emergency services the MFB, CFA and FRV. The jobs you will have to undertake here is simulating cyber-attacks to prevent real attacks, you will have to be part of a team that monitors a cyber system 24/7, as well as making sure the MFB is up to date in all there security standards.</p>

<P>
The requirements for this job are a minimum of 5 years’ experience in the cyber security field, as well as having very good communication skills both online and in person. You must have a good understanding of cloud environments like google, you need to be able work with proxy servers, anti-malware solutions as well as password access management systems.</P>

<p> Already I know some of the basics when it comes to proxy servers as well as I have a fairly good idea how google and other cloud environments work. I believe I have good communication skills both talking in person and online. I plan to get the other skills by studying subjects at university or TAFE that will help with the requirements for this job. At the same time, I can continue to build on the skills I already know by watching tutorials on YouTube and google.</p>

<p> personal profile</P>

  <P> For my Myers-Briggs test my results were ENFP which stands for, Extraverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving. For my online learning test my results is that I am a tactile learner. The last test I chose to do was a creativity test and for that I got a 68.18. </P>
  <p> The results to me are interesting because I have never done a test like these before it was interesting to see my results and how accurate they really are. For the Myers-Briggs test I got ENFP which says that I am independent but friendly and cooperative. For my online learning test, I found out that I am a tactile learner which basically means that I am more of a hands-on learner than a visual learner. For my last test, the creativity test I got a 68.18 this means to me that I am creative when coming up with idea for projects as well as getting the work done when I need to. Overall, all these results show me that I have a creative mind and that I prefer to learn this by doing it rather than watching or listening.</P>

    <p> My results are going to influence my behaviour in a group probably for the better rather than the worse, this is because as stated above I am very creative which is a big help when it comes to group projects, even though my results said that I’m independent this means I will get my part of the project done on time and I’m extremely flexible when it comes to group work and group roles.</P>

    <P> I should take this into account when trying to form a team by talking to other people and finding out what everyone else’s results were and try to find people who maybe have a good leadership attribute and other people who are creative and are good at getting there parts done on time.</p>

        <p> project idea</p>

         <p> overview</P>

           <p> For my project idea, I have always wanted to create or help develop a video game using unity, my idea is that I want to create a playable operator for one of my favourite games Rainbow Six Siege. I would make both the character and the map in unity using their software. The map will be an open arear and the character will be a defensive operator.</P>

             <p> motivation</p>

             <p> The reason I want to do this project is because the creators of Rainbow Six Siege actually let people send in their projects for the game like a new weapon, map or operator which gives me motivation  to make something because if they think it is good enough that means there could be a chance that it gets put in the real game which would be amazing. Siege now is one of the most played video games with over 2.3 million people playing it everyday for more than 1 hour at a time, so creating something for a game that is as big as this would be amazing. Gaming is also taking over the world now so the market for it is getting better and better.</p>

        <p>Description</p>

        <p> when it comes to naming him, I still have no idea on what to name him. So, for my operator I want to create a defensive operator which would use sound like foot steps or gun shots to distract the other team, you would have 2 drones that you can drive around the maps playing gunshot noises and footsteps. For the drone the ways to destroy it would be by explosives like grenades, breaching charges etc… as well as the drone can be shot by any weapon. When it comes to the operator, he would be a 2 armour and 2 speed which means he would be balanced. He would be a New Zealand operator because what the creators of the game are trying to do is have an operator from different countries and New Zealand don’t have one yet.</P>
          <p> The operator would have for his primary weapons, a MP5 SMG and a sapz-12 shotgun. For his secondary weapon he would have a desert eagle, for his equipment he would have barbed wire and a deployable shield. His drone will be the same speed as all the other drones in the game and will be able to go threw all drone holes and under barricaded doors the only downside will be that the drone will not be able to jump over shield so this means you have to place your shields strategically around the map.</P>

            <p>Siege is a very strategic game with everything having a counter to it, so the counter for my operator would be twitch drones which can zap the drone as well as thatcher EMP grenades which destroy the drone immediately, as well as all your normal weapons and equipment can destroy the drone. With all the operators in this game they all have a bio like where they all came from, all the army training they have completed as well as basic facts about themselves like there name, age, height, weight and what country they born in. so these are all things I will have to think about and make when it comes to creating him.</P>

              <P>Tools and Technologies</p>

                <p> To make this project you can use a number of different tools and software’s to make it, the easiest one to use for me would be unity because there game design software is very good and is used by some of the world’s biggest game developers, with over 600 million games made with the unity engine. When It comes to designing the operator graphically, I will use adobe illustrator and photoshop because I have a little bit of experience in using these software’s from high school. With unity you can import a creation from photoshop or illustrator so I can work on how he moves and uses his drone.</P>

                <p> Skills required </P>

                  <p> There a couple of skills that are required, like I will need to know how to be able to implement the movement of the character. Another skill that is required for this project is how I am going to be able to make the character into a 3D model instead of being in 2D, you can make the basics and design on illustrator and photoshop but turning it into a 3D model will be difficult. Most of these skills I have done before but there are some that I will need to either watch a YouTube video on how to do it or just practice until I get it right.</p>

                  <p> overview</p>

                  <p> If this project does become successful, then my end product could be published into rainbow six siege and made into a real operator in their game. The development could have a massive impact on my future when it comes to game character design and even graphic design.</P>
